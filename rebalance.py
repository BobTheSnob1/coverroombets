"""
Rebalance a mock-stock portfolio so that each ticker in the market has the same total value.
Reads two text files:
  1. A ‚Äúportfolio‚Äù file containing your current cash and owned-shares listing.
  2. A ‚Äúmarket‚Äù file containing the latest closing prices for all tickers.

Usage:
    python rebalance_all.py --portfolio portfolio.txt --market market.txt

Outputs a series of commands of the form:
    !buy TICKER QTY
    !sell TICKER QTY
which will rebalance your holdings so that every ticker listed in the market file
ends up with (as close as possible) the same total value.  Any leftover cash that
cannot be spent on a whole share is minimized.
